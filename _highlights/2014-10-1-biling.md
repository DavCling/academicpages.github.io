Many of the worldâ€™s poorest people live in linguistically diverse countries where bilingualism is a distinct and important form of human capital.  When communication among workers increases productivity, there are economic incentives to learn a second language.  I study how the growth of industrial employment increased bilingualism in India between 1931 and 1961. Indian factories were linguistically mixed.  I exploit industrial clustering and sectoral demand growth for identification.  The effect on bilingualism was strongest in import-competing districts and among local linguistic minorities.  Industrialization also increased literacy.  Bilingualism was mainly the result of learning, rather than than migration or assimilation.  It was not a byproduct of becoming literate.  My results shed new light on human capital investment in developing economies and on the long-run evolution of languages and cultures.
