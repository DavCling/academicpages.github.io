We explore how variation in entrepreneurs' displayed passion affects informal investor interest in
start-up ventures by examining neural responses to entrepreneurs' pitches using functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). We find that founders displaying high passion increase
investor neural engagement by 39% and investor interest in the venture by 26% over those
displaying low passion. A one standard deviation increase in neural engagement is associated
with an 8% percent increase in investors' interest in investing in a start-up company relative to
the mean. Moreover, our findings indicate that neural engagement may account for some of the
effect of founder passion on investor interest. Our study has implications for both research on,
and the practice of, entrepreneurship.
