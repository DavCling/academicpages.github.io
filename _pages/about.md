Welcome to my little corner of the web. I am an applied microeconomist and economic historian with a broad set of research interests. I did my Ph.D. at Harvard University with fields in labor economics, development economics, and economic history. Much of my work draws on earlier training in anthropology and linguistics at the University of Chicago. 

When I find a research question that is important and I think I can answer convincingly, I tend to dive in. If you peruse my research page you'll see I've published research on language, religious identity, social status, entrepreneurship, and the economic history of India. I use the full range of methods available to the modern economist, from archival research to observational data to field and lab experiments. 

I've recently begun a project on the diffusion of innovation in the United States after World War Two. I haven't done a U.S. economic history project before and I'm very excited to be moving into this area.
